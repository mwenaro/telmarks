            <div class="card-body">
              Telmark Kenya platform began as Telmark Kenya sponsored private
              offline savings platform under World Stock Exchange market for a
              few trusted personnel from 2005, after which members came to an
              agreement and introduced more classified features that came fully
              to service as from 10th April 2013 (a digital marketing and
              affiliate products). They saw this of big benefit to the public to
              enable services reach as many people as possible thus the company
              upgraded from an offline saving platform to an online platform
              which lead to the need for coming up with a web application to
              make it easier for new investors to access the services.

          Securities Products Fund listings on this Site are only suitable for
          Accredited Investors who are familiar with and willing to accept the
          high risk associated with private International investments.
          Securities sold through private placements are not publicly traded
          and, therefore, are less liquid. Additionally, Investors may receive
          restricted units that may be subject to holding period requirements.
          Fund offerings on Telmark Kenya will target companies seeking private
          placement investments, which tend to be in earlier stages of
          development and have not yet been fully tested in the public
          marketplace. Investing in private placements requires high risk
          tolerance, low liquidity concerns, and long-term commitments.
          Investors must be able to afford to lose their entire investment. For
          those reasons, these offerings may be made available only to certain
          institutional investors and high net worth individuals and entities.
          As with all alternative investments, investors must meet certain
          eligibility tests to qualify as purchasers. Currently, entities must
          have assets of at least $5 million (or all individual owners meet
          accredited investor tests). Individuals must have a net worth of more
          than $1000 excluding primary residence or gross income for each of the
          last two years of at least $200,000 ($300,000 with spouse) with the
          expectation of the same income in the current year. <br />
          <br />

          rise. Past performance is not a guarantee of future performance. The
